                In order to use the App, you must have a valid Spotify account. You must provide accurate and complete information when creating your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, and you agree to notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account.

                Data Privacy
                The App may collect and use certain data related to your use of Spotify, including but not limited to your listening history, playlists, and other data related to your account. By using the App, you agree that we may collect and use this data in accordance with our privacy policy.

                Intellectual Property
                The App and its content, including but not limited to text, graphics, images, and software, are the property of the App developer or its licensors, and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not use the App or its content for any commercial purpose without the prior written consent of the App developer.

                Limitation of Liability
                The App developer will not be liable for any damages arising from your use of the App or your inability to use the App, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

                Indemnification
                You agree to indemnify and hold the App developer harmless from any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.

                Termination
                The App developer may terminate your use of the App at any time for any reason. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete any copies of the App that you have downloaded.

                Changes to these Terms
                The App developer may update these Terms from time to time. If we make any material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
